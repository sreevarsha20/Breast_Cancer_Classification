 🧠 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning 🎗️

This project applies **Machine Learning** to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**.  
The goal is to support early detection through data-driven insights.

 📌 Overview
- Preprocessed and standardized clinical diagnostic data  
- Trained models: **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**  
- Evaluated using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC Score**  
- Achieved up to **98% accuracy** with Random Forest Classifier  

 ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- Python • pandas • numpy • matplotlib • seaborn • scikit-learn  

 📊 Result
**Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
**Accuracy:** ~98%  
**Key Features:** Radius Mean, Texture, Smoothness  

🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and view results.
